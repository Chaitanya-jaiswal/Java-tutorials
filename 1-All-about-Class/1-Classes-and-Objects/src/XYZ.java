/*
    NOTES:

    1)  There are two different main functions in two different classes.

        Q) Which main function will run/ be executed?
        => It depends mainly on the file_name and whether any class is declared as public.

        a)  File_name different from the names of classes inside the file
            Example:
                file_name -> "XYZ.java"
                class_names -> "class First", "class Second"

            ->  If we compile the "XYZ.java" file containing "class First" and "class Second",
            ->  Both classes will be compiled into two separate bytecode files:
                - "First.class"
                - "Second.class"

            ->  After compilation:
                - We can run either "First" or "Second" independently by using:
                    - `java First`
                    - `java Second`
                - Thus, the main() method of whichever class we specify in the java command will execute.
                - The filename ("XYZ.java") does not affect which main() runs when no class is public.

        b)  File_name same as a public class inside the file
            Example:
                file_name -> "First.java"
                class_names -> "public class First", "class Second"

            ->  In Java, if a class is declared as `public`, then:
                - The filename must exactly match the public class name (case-sensitive).
                - Only one public class is allowed per .java file.

            ->  After compilation:
                - Both "First.class" and "Second.class" will still be generated.
                - However, at runtime:
                    - It is standard to run the public class (`java First`).
                    - Other non-public classes like "Second" can be accessed internally (creating objects, calling methods).
                    - Running `java Second` directly **may not always work** reliably and is not a good practice if a public class exists.

    âš¡ Important Points:
    - If **no class is public**, you can run any class that has a valid `main()` method.
    - If a **public class exists**, Java expects you to run the public class.
    - "private", "protected" modifiers are not allowed for top-level classes (only public or default are allowed at file level).
